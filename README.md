# 🚀 160 Days of DSA with GeeksforGeeks 💚

Hi! I’m Zayf, and this repository is my daily log for the **GeeksforGeeks 160 Days DSA Challenge**.  
I’m solving data structures and algorithms problems consistently for 160 days straight — one day, one problem (or more!), every single day.

---

## 📌 **What’s inside?**
- ✅ Daily solutions to DSA problems.
- ✅ Neat folders named by day and problem.
- ✅ Well-commented code to understand the logic.
- ✅ My notes or explanations (when needed).

---

## 🎯 **Why am I doing this?**
Because *Consistency > Motivation!*  
- To strengthen my core DSA skills.
- To build interview-ready problem-solving habits.
- To have a public record of my learning journey.
- And maybe… to grab some cool GeeksforGeeks swags! 🏆✨
